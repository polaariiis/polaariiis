# Hey there, I'm Avazbek 👋

I’m a developer who loves **building things with code**. Most of the time you’ll find me working in **C++**, exploring the ins and outs of **game engine design**.  
Along the way, I also enjoy working with **C#**, **Python**, and web tech like **JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and SCSS**.  

On the systems side, I have some experience with **Ubuntu scripting** and **Bash scripting**, which I use to automate tasks and make my workflow smoother.
